# Most challenging problem
The most challenging problem i solved was largest histogram using monotonic stack.
The Largest Rectangle in Histogram problem was challenging because the obvious brute-force approach is too slow, forcing me to think in terms of optimization rather than simple iteration. The hardest part was understanding how to use a monotonic stack to efficiently find the nearest smaller bar on both the left and right for every index. Initially, it wasn’t intuitive why storing indices and maintaining an increasing stack helps determine boundaries without re-scanning the array. I solved it by performing two stack passes—one from the left and one from the right—to precompute these boundaries in O(n) time. After that, computing the maximum rectangle using the formula height × (right − left − 1) became straightforward. This problem pushed me to break my brute-force mindset and recognize patterns used in advanced algorithmic optimizations. It significantly improved my understanding of stack-based techniques and problem-solving under time constraints.
